🤗🤗🤗Welcome to my curated list of AI for MD simulation labs! 

> 📝 Note: The list is inspired by the protein design lists that @[Zuricho](https://github.com/Zuricho) has posted on [Github]([Zuricho/ProteinDesignLabs: List of computational protein design research labs (github.com)](https://github.com/Zuricho/ProteinDesignLabs/tree/main)).

This list serves as a public reference for labs developing machine learning methods to enhance either the accuracy or the efficiency of MD simulation. While I've tried to be comprehensive, my knowledge is absolutely very limited. 

I apologize if I've missed your lab or labs you're familiar with. Suggestions for additions are highly welcomed – comments could be posted on [].
