ü§óü§óü§óWelcome to my curated list of AI for MD simulation labs! 

This list serves as a public reference for labs developing machine learning methods to enhance either the accuracy or the efficiency of MD simulation. While I've made effort to be comprehensive, my knowledge is absolutely limited. 

I apologize if I've missed your lab or labs you're familiar with. Suggestions for additions are highly welcomed ‚Äì please feel free to open new issues.

> üìù Note: The list is inspired by the protein design lists that @[Zuricho](https://github.com/Zuricho) has posted on [Github]([Zuricho/ProteinDesignLabs: List of computational protein design research labs (github.com)](https://github.com/Zuricho/ProteinDesignLabs/tree/main)).
