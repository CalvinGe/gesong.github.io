I have teached five labs of Chem 110 Honor Undergraduate course: 

* Quantum Mechanics
* Molecular Modeling with Spartan
* Integrated Rate Laws
* Freezing Point Depression
* Electrochemistry

My jobs were mainly discussing the pre-lab materials, teaching 3 classes (each 8-10 ppl) in lab and grading for the reports.
