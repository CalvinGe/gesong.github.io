D. E. Shaw is arguably the most successful geak in the history, considering his influence in science (membership of N.A.S.) and the money he made (Billionaire).

When I was grabbing some food, D. E. Shaw was talking with Prof. Tamar Schlick.

He said in the talk that he is still coding by himself in the nights.  lol.
