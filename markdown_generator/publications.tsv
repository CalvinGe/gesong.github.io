2025-02-05  NepoIP/MM: Towards Accurate Biomolecular Simulation with a Machine Learning/Molecular Mechanics Model Incorporating Polarization Effects    Arxiv   We found that the nanosecond MD simulations based on NepoIP/MM are stable for the periodic solvated dipeptide system and the converged sampling shows excellent agreement with the reference QM/MM level. Moreover, we show that a single NepoIP model can be transferable across different MM force fields, as well as extremely different MM environment of water and proteins, laying the foundation for developing a general machine learning biomolecular force field to be used in ML/MM with electrostatic embedding.    	arXiv:2502.02801    NepoIP/MM: Towards Accurate Biomolecular Simulation with a Machine Learning/Molecular Mechanics Model Incorporating Polarization Effects    https://arxiv.org/abs/2502.02801
