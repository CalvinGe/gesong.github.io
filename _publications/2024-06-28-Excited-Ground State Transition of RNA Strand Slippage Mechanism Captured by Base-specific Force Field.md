excerpt: 'Our results of capturing the strand slippage, excited-ground transition, de novo folding, and simulations for various typical RNA motifs indicate that BSFF2 should be one of valuable tools for dynamic conformation research and structure prediction of RNA, and a future contribution to RNA-targeted drug design as well as RNA therapy development.'

Our results of capturing the strand slippage, excited-ground transition, *de novo* folding, and simulations for various typical RNA motifs indicate that BSFF2 should be one of valuable tools for dynamic conformation research and structure prediction of RNA, and a future contribution to RNA-targeted drug design as well as RNA therapy development.
