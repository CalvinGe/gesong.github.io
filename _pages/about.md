<i>If you want to master something, teach it. The more you teach, the better you learn. Teaching is a powerful tool to learning.</i>                                            

-Richard P. Feynman

 若欲精通某事，便需将其教给他人。

# Research Interests

My General research interest is to explore the physics principles underlying life systems and apply them to improve health. To address this goal, I'm investigating and modeling the interaction in biomolecules by theoretical and compuational chemistry.

# Ongoing Projects

* Development of phospho-proteins force field
* Development of RNA force field
* Development of machine learned force field
