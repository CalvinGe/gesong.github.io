# Research Interests

My General research interest is to explore the physics principles underlying life systems and apply them to improve health. To address this goal, I'm investigating and modeling the interaction in biomolecules by theoretical and compuational chemistry.

# Ongoing Projects

* Development of phospho-proteins force field
* Development of RNA force field
* Development of machine learned force field
